# SE4458 Assignment 2 
## Create your own API Gateway

### Introduction:
This project is a simple Node.js application built using the Express.js framework. It serves as a microservice providing a single API endpoint that responds to HTTP GET requests with a predefined message. This project demonstrates the basic setup of a Node.js server with Express, illustrating how to define routes and handle incoming requests.

### Design:
The project follows a typical RESTful API architecture using Node.js with Express.js. Each component, such as service-A, service-B, and the API gateway, contains its own set of API endpoints responsible for specific functionalities. These endpoints are defined within the respective JavaScript files. The project leverages Express.js for routing and middleware handling, allowing for easy creation and management of API routes.
